HydraTwin: The First Integrated Digital Twin Platform Built on EPANET
HydraTwin is a next-generation hydraulic modeling and digital twin platform designed to bridge the gap between traditional water models and real-world utility data. While multiple tools today support GIS-based model preparation, none provide a cohesive system that combines GIS network building, real-time SCADA feeds, CRM customer meter data, and calibration tools into one EPANET-compatible environment. HydraTwin uniquely transforms static hydraulic models into dynamic, continuously updated digital twins.
Water network digital twin software description (HydraTwin):
    • Model Building & Data Import Capabilities
    • Import Shapefiles (SHP) with full attribute tables for pipes, junctions, valves, pumps, tanks, etc, all available GIS database, matching their fields and attributes with the corresponding element in Epanet. 
    • Import DXF files as basemaps for spatial reference.
    • Auto-generate network elements from SHP geometry and metadata, i.e. a defined pipe in GIS database should immediately auto-generate into a pipe in Epanet, while an end of a pipe and a start of another pipe should auto-generate into a junction.
    • Intelligent attribute-matching engine that maps SHP attribute fields to EPANET model parameters, while DXF files are used strictly as visual basemaps (roads, buildings, and background features).
    • Georeferenced display of model components on an interactive map, with the ability to populate node and pipe properties from imported tables.
    • Spreadsheet-style tables for all elements: junctions, pipes, tanks, valves, etc, with bulk editing capabilities (multi-select, global replace, formula-based updates), e.g. edit all junction IDs or add DMA names to groups of nodes in one action.
    • Calibration & Digital Twin Integration
    • Connect pressure logger data from selected critical network points, and import DMA and any other flow meters inflow/outflow readings in real-time or near real-time into SCADA.
    • Real-time or near real-time import from SCADA to update the previously mentioned data along with reservoir levels, pump statuses, valve operations and any other important data that can be imported from SCADA and can be utilized into the model.
    • Import customer meter readings (non-real-time) from CRM database, if the utility has AMI/AMR systems then real-time readings can be imported, however, our first potential pilot doesn’t have this. Customers locations can be also imported from the CRM database, and then calculated distributed demands based on actual customer consumption. In intermittent water supply scheme, actual consumption depends on quantities supplied and not real demand.
    • Compare field measurements to simulated results to calibrate.

    • Digital Twin Foundations
    • Base calibrated model serves as the backbone for the digital twin, where automated updating of demand patterns from CRM data and dynamic updates from SCADA for system behavior provides the ability to simulate reality at any moment.
    • Simulation & Analysis Tools
    • Real-time scenario simulation, with live comparison to model pressures with the data provided from the loggers, and real-time calculations for DMA’s NRW percentage.
    • Provide alerts for abnormal or unexpected hydraulic behavior.
    •  Important Features 
    • Leak detection analytics: The software analyzes changes in pressure and flow patterns in the network and compares them to the expected hydraulic behavior generated by the model. A leak can result in sudden drops in pressure at nearby junctions, unusual increases in flow through certain pipes or DMA inlets, differences between measured vs. simulated values. Therefore, by continuously comparing real-time SCADA data with the model’s predictions, the system can detect deviations that match known leak patterns. When these appear, the software can identify where a leak is likely occurring and how large it may be.
    • Demand forecasting using historical consumption.
    • Machine learning-based calibration tools, by automatically adjusting model parameters, such as pipe roughness, demand patterns, leakage coefficients, or valve settings, so that the model’s results match real-world measurements.
    • Cloud-based storage and version-control for model iterations.
